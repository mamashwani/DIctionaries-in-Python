Using dictionaries with files to read in text data, loops, functions, and conditional execution. 


# Description:
- Identify the words associated with telephone numbersby using dictionaries. 
- You will read in three and four letter words and then have the user provide a number. 
- Using that number, you will determine the words associated with the number.
- Your program should read the list of words from “words.txt” into a list, removing the new-line character at the end and filter out the three and four-letter words.
- Your program should ask the user for a phone number for conversion.
- Your program should include functions to convert the number into a string and to check that a given string is a word from the word list.
- You should output all possible matches for a given phone number.
